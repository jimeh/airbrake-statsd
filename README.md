# Airbrake-Statsd

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jimeh/airbrake-statsd.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jimeh/airbrake-statsd)

Extends the [Airbrake][] gem to also report exceptions to Esty's [StatsD][]
statistics aggregator.

## Installation

Command line:

    gem install airbrake-statsd

Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'airbrake-statsd'
```

## Usage

It's assumed you know what both Airbrake and StatsD are before attempting to
use this gem. If you don't, come back when you do know :)

All that's needed is to require `airbrake-statsd` and call
`Airbrake::Statsd.configure` and Airbrake notifications will automatically be
sent to StatsD and Airbrake.

```ruby
require 'airbrake'
require 'airbrake-statsd'

Airbrake::Statsd.configure do |config|
  config.host = 'my-statsd-server'
  config.port = 8125
  config.namespace = 'my_awesome_app'
end

Airbrake.notify({})
```
